     <!-- A sticky position element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It's positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport, and then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed). Here, it will start sticking to the top of the viewport once you scroll past it. -->
